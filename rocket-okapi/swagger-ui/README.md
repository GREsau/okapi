# Swagger UI

This is a project the visualizes the `openapi.json` file into a webpage the user can navigate and
use for searching though the API documentation.

Repo: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui
Webpage: https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/

## How to update
Download the latest release: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases/latest
Copy the following file from the downloaded archive.
All files are located in the folder `/swagger-ui-x.xx.x/dist/`:
 - index.html
 - index.css
 - oauth2-redirect.html
 - swagger-ui-bundle.js
 - swagger-ui-standalone-preset.js
 - swagger-ui.css
 - swagger-initializer.js

The file `swagger-initializer.js` needs to be update to point to the correct json file:
```diff
    window.ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
+       configUrl: "./swagger-ui-config.json",
-       url: "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json",
        dom_id: '#swagger-ui',
```
The `swagger-ui-config.json` file is generated by `rocket-okapi`.

Make sure you also document the update in the changelog.
